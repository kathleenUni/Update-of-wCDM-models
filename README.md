# Update-of-wCDM-models

In this paper, CLASS and MontePython were used. This repository contains the constant (w0CDM) model, the quadratic model (JBP), the logarithmic model (GE), and the oscillatory model. 

Here you find the _____ file where the cases of each model were added in order to be called later on through the param file of MontePython.

For the oscillatory model, a numerical integral calculator is added to the file of the oscillatory model.
